# hello_World
The beginning stuffs I am trying to do following the hello_world guide
I am a graduate student in Forest Sciences at the University of Tokyo. My research is about all aspects of plant improvement using mycorrhiza, mainly arbuscular mycorrhiza.
Trying again what I've just learned, but without looking at the guide.
